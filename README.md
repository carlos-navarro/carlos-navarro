### Hi there 👋

# Carlos Tomàs Navarro Segarra

Well, this is me...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the nuts and bolts of Open Source management because I'm a lifelong learner...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a few local cooperative projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with almos anything! I'm a forever novice software craftsman...
- 💬 Ask me about applying regulations with common sense. I'm a non-standard standards champion!
- 📫 How to reach me? Here: [carlos-navarro](https://carlos-navarro.github.io)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been working with Red Hat so closely, so long, that I feel like I'm an AXA-blue RedHatter.
- 👽 Too many context switching? A little ADD/ADHD? Anyway, slash man means [Slash Person/People](https://medium.com/@gnorby01/how-to-know-if-youre-a-slash-person-44c1e95a7a1d). British folks, don't be cruel...
